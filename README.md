# Evie - GitHub & X Account Verification Agent

Welcome to **Evie**, an AI-powered agent designed to enhance the trustworthiness and quality assurance of open-source projects on GitHub and monitor changes in X accounts.

## Overview

Evie is an innovative AI agent that:

- **Analyzes GitHub Repositories** for legitimacy, quality, and error-free code.
- **Monitors X Accounts** for changes in content or identity, such as deleted tweets or name changes.

## Features

### GitHub Repository Verification

- **Legitimacy Check**: Ensures that the repository is not a clone or contains plagiarized content.
- **Code Quality Assessment**: Scans for errors, style adherence, and potential security vulnerabilities.
- **Errorless Code Verification**: Uses advanced algorithms to check if the code is free from syntax errors or logical mistakes.

### X Account Monitoring

- **Tweet History**: Checks if any tweets have been deleted from the account.
- **Account Identity**: Monitors if the account has changed its display name or username.
